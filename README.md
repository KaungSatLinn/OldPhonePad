# OldPhonePad Project Overview

Since there is no requirement for creating UI or building a web app, I choose to write a simple console application.
OldPhonePad is a console application that simulates the old mobile phone keypad input method for typing text messages. 
It converts sequences of input which simulate the key presses of old phone pad into corresponding characters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Building the Project
To build the project, run the following command in the project directory:

```sh
dotnet build
```

### Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
dotnet run
```

### Usage
1. Run the application.
2. Enter a sequence of key presses (e.g., 2 22 222# for ABC).
3. The application will display the corresponding text.

#### Example
```sh
Write Value & Enter to see result!
2 22 222#
